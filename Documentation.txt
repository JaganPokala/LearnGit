git important terminologies

Repo - folder of the project on which you are working which is tracked by git
there are 3 types of areas - 
working directory - this is where you make your changes
staging area - this is the area where we bring files from working directory and make 
               commit or take snapshot we do this using a command 
git Directory - this is the final repository , when we commit 

we can move from working directory to staging area by using add command 
when we do commit in staging area cur directory becomes git directory

push command - 
pull command - 
clone - 
merge - 
confilct , resolving confilct
     
cd.. go out side the current directoryls

first of all you have to initialize current dir as git repo
if you want to track using git 
.git folder holds all the info to track ur project 
this folder is created by git init command but u can't see it since it is hidden folder 

this is still showing as there are pending changes
this is because we r currently in working directory

git directory contains final files 
inorder to move from working dir to git dir we have to bring files from working dir to 
staging area by git add
for staging area to git dir -> git commit
?why do we use staging instead of directly commiting to gir dir

we can't commit without a message 
we can do this by using --allow-empty

if you ran the git init in the wrong folder what will you do, you can just dlt git
file which is hidden in the your repo

git status - is used to see what type of changes you have made in your repo

if you do git add . this will add all the changes instead of one by one
